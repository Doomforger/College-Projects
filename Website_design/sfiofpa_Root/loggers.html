      <h3>Pennsylvania's Professional Timber Harvesters</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Pennsylvania’s professional timber harvesting workforce serves an essential role in ensuring the sustainability of our state’s forest resources. Each day they operate as the boots on the ground, carrying out the critical management activities that sustain our forests and supply our forest products industry. There is no other link in the wood fiber supply chain that has as much of a direct impact on the management of our state’s forests. As such, timber harvesters in Pennsylvania are vital stewards of our forestlands.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Additionally, Pennsylvania’s timber harvesters also clock in each morning to one of the country’s most hazardous occupations; with a fatality rate more than 30 times higher than the national average. The tools and equipment essential to the job pose hazards wherever they are used and even more so when dangerous environmental conditions common to harvesting job sites such as rough terrain, inclement weather, and remote work locations are factored in. The nature of the work requires that timber harvesters repeatedly contend with massive weights and unforgiving momentums of falling, rolling, and sliding trees and logs. Safety should always be in the forefront of their mind and the chief goal of every one of their operations.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The fact that more than 7,000 individuals have participated in the Pennsylvania SFI® Professional Timber Harvester Training Program demonstrates that Pennsylvania’s SFI Qualified Logging Professionals take the safety and sustainability aspects of their industry very seriously. Well educated and prepared timber harvesters are critical to the management of Pennsylvania's forests. The resources included on this website are designed to supplement the PA SFI Professional Timber Harvester Training Program and provide a one-stop shop for the tools and information that are critical to Pennsylvania’s timber harvesting workforce.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Core Training Requirements</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In order to be considered a SFI Qualified Logging Professional through the Pennsylvania SFI Professional Timber Harvester Training Program, an individual must complete two core courses and provide proof of current First Aid and CPR certification within a 24-month period. Core training takes three days to complete, after which you need to attend four hours of continuing education training each year to maintain a current training status. All training participants will recieve an updated copy of their training record after each course they complete. Please refer to the Training Program Policy for complete details on training requirements.</p>

        <li>
          <p><a href="https://sfiofpa.org/course_description.php">Professional Timber Harvesting Essentals</a> (8-credit hours) Covers general safety considerations, chainsaw safety, logging equipment safety (harvesters, loaders, skidders, etc.), trucking safety and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standards that apply to timber harvesting and related activities. Also covers pertinent aspects of Pennsylvania’s Clean Streams laws and other water resource protection regulations, Best Management Practices (BMPs), hazardous material control, and logging aesthetics. Professional Timber Harvesting Essentials can be taken for continuing education credit if you have not already completed the training in the last 5 years.</p>
        </li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li>
          <p><a href="https://sfiofpa.org/course_description.php">Game of Logging ‐ Level 1</a> (8-credit hours) Introduces participants to open face felling, bore cutting, and the 5-step felling plan using a hands on approach. The course covers personal protective equipment, chainsaw safety features and reactive forces, proper chain filing techniques, and understanding important hinge wood properties and strength. This course is approximately 8 hours in length and is conducted outdoors. Class sizes are limited to provide participants one-on-one interaction with the instructor. Participants must provide their own safety equipment. Game of Logging - Level 1 can be taken for continuing education credit if you have not already completed the training in the last 5 years.</p>
        </li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li>
          <p><a href="https://sfiofpa.org/course_description.php">Certfied First Aid and CPR</a> (4-credit hours) Because timber harvesting is a hazardous occupation, federal law (OSHA Regulations) requires that everyone who works in the woods maintain current First Aid & CPR (both) training from a provider who can issue a certificate or a card as documentation of hands on training (i.e. no online certifications will be accepted). Individuals do not need to complete this training through the PA SFI Professional Timber Harvester Training Program; however, they must provide proof of First Aid & CPR certification to satisfy this core training requirement (we cannot accept the MSHA 5000-23 form as satisfaction of this requirement). Training certificates can be submitted to the Pennsylvania SIC office via email, mail, or fax. First Aid & CPR training is not accepted for continuing education credit.</p>
