        <p><strong>Non-PA SFI Course Credit Form -</strong> Training courses taken from other sources may qualify for PA SFI continuing education credit, provided the subject of the course is relevant to the SFI program. Individuals seeking CE credit must submit this completed course registration form, a course agenda, and the administrative fee to the PA SFI Implementation Committee office. One year of CE credit will be given for a 4-hour course and two years of credit will be given for an 8-hour course. <a href="https://www.sfiofpa.org/_download_link.php?did=10">Download Non-PA SFI Course Credit Form</a></p>

        <p><strong>PA SFI Treatment Unit Sustainability Assessment Form (TUSAF) -</strong> Provides forest landowners and forestry practitioners with a tool to assess their current forest condition, develop a desired forest condition, and evaluate the results of their harvesting operation. This assessment form can be used in combination with the TUSAF Sustainability Key below. (Also, refer to "Managing Timber to Promote Sustainable Forests" under the publications section of this website for more information on the use of this form). <a href="https://www.sfiofpa.org/_download_link.php?did=9">Download PA SFI Treatment Unit Sustainability Assessment Form (TUSAF)</a></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>PA SFI Treatment Unit Sustainability Key (TUSAF) -</strong> This key can be used to determine whether a proposed timber harvest will achieve a sustainable outcome. The sustainability key asks a series of paired questions or couplets that relate to the harvesting decisions that were made for the stand. The key provides guidance by suggesting the proposed operation will result in a potentially sustainable outcome, an uncertain outcome that should be reconsidered, or a potentially unsustainable outcome. This sustainability key can be used in combination with the TUSAF Assessment Form above. (Also, refer to "Managing Timber to Promote Sustainable Forests" under the publications section of this website for more information on the use of this form). <a href="https://www.sfiofpa.org/_download_link.php?did=30">Download PA SFI Treatment Unit Sustainability Key (TUSAF)</a></p>

        <p><strong>PA SFI Inconsistent Practices Form -</strong> The Pennsylvania SFI Implementation Committee (SIC) responds to allegations of practices that appear inconsistent with the SFI Standard principles and objectives. Inconsistent practices either cause or have the potential to cause, problems associated with a timber harvest. Likely issues are soil erosion, stream sedimentation, failed regeneration, and/or poor residual stand conditions. The Inconsistent Practices Program provides a venue for reporting and addressing these concerns. <a href="https://www.sfiofpa.org/_download_link.php?did=1">Download PA SFI Inconsistent Practices Form</a></p>

        <p><strong>Erosion & Sediment (E&S) Control Plan Template for a Timber Harvesting Operation</strong> (3800-FM-BCW0539) In Pennsylvania a written Erosion and Sedimentation Control (E&S) Plan is required for all operations that involve 5,000 square feet (0.11 acres) or more of earth disturbance, or that occur in a special protection watershed (classified HQ/EV). An E&S Plan is a site-specific plan identifying the use of E&S Best Management Practices (BMPs) to minimize accelerated erosion and sedimentation. The pertinent regulations can be found in the Pennsylvania Code, Title 25. Environmental Protection, Chapter 102.4(b). This template plan can be used to comply with these regulations. (See also below - BMP Inspection Template; Preparedness, Prevention and Contingency Plan Template) <a href="https://www.sfiofpa.org/_download_link.php?did=5">Download E&S Control Plan for a Timber Harvesting Operation</a></p>

        <p><strong>Timber Harvesting BMP Inspection Template</strong> It is a requirement of 25 PA Code §102.4(b)(5)(x) that a maintenance program be conducted to provide for the operation and maintenance of all BMPs to be inspected on a weekly basis and after each stormwater event. The program must provide for completion of a written report documenting each inspection, and all BMP repair, or replacement and maintenance activities (reflected in Section 12 of the Erosion & Sediment Control Plan Template). This optional template is being provided as an acceptable standard format for written BMP inspection reports on non-permitted timber harvesting operations. <a href="https://www.sfiofpa.org/_download_link.php?did=33">Download Timber Harvesting BMP Inspection Template</a></p>

        <p><strong>Preparedness, Prevention, and Contingency (PPC) Plan Template for Timber Harvesting Operations</strong> Timber harvesting operations that store, use or transport fuels, chemicals, solvents, pesticides, fertilizers, petrochemicals, solid wastes or other hazardous materials onto, on or from the harvest site during earth disturbance activities must prepare and implement a written Preparedness, Prevention, and Contingency (PPC) Plan under 25 PA. Code § 91.34(b) and § 102.5(l). These regulations are reflected in Section 13 of the Erosion & Sediment Control Plan Template. The purpose of the PPC Plan is to prevent and control accidental discharges of polluting materials to surface or groundwater. This optional plan template is designed to be used in conjunction with an Erosion & Sediment Control Plan. A copy of the PPC plan and any subsequent revisions must be maintained on-site. <a href="https://www.sfiofpa.org/_download_link.php?did=34">Download PPC Plan Template for Timber Harvesting Operations</a></p>
